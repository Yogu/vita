ViTA Visual Text Analytics for Digital Humanities
=================================================

**ViTA** is web-based a tool to visualize the contents of literature, especially
novels.  It parses ebooks, extracts data about characters, places or the text in
general and is able to automatically generate different interactive
visualizations that allow exploration of the text.

If you are missing a book that is public domain (e.g. the author died more than
70 years ago), feel free to provide us an ePub file so that we can add it.
