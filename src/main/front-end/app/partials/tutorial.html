      ViTA allows the import of text-, epub2- and epub3-documents.
	  Before the import the user has the possibility before the import to set the analysis parameters. 
	  The user can set the count for the Word Cloud items and the granularity in the Graph Network. 
	  He can enable the stop word list and the filter for unlikely person and place names. At last he can choose between three NLP tools: ANNIE, OpenNLP and Stanford.
	  <br/>
	  The Preview also provides the user with a list of all documents which he had imported. 
	  If there is a checkmark before the title of the document in the list, the analysis was correctly executed. 
	  If there is an exclamation mark before the title, the analysis has failed. 
	  The play icon before the title illustrates the procedure of the analysis.
	  The user has the ability to cancel the analysis of processing documents by clicking on the cancel icon next to the trash icon.
	  He also has the ability to restart the analysis of the canceled documents, by clicking in the restart icon next to the trash icon.
	  <br/>
	  On the right, there is a preview of the chosen document displayed. 
	  Again the user has the possibility to restart the analysis, but with new analysis parameters by clicking on Analysis Parameters next to the Rename button below the preview. 
	  The new analyzed document will be add to the list.

      The <strong>Overview</strong> – a document is imported/chosen and the analysis and interaction can start.
	  This view gives the user some general facts about the document, for example the most frequent occurred characters. Furthermore the <strong>Overview</strong> gives you links to the various analyzations. 
 	  Thereby, the user has the opportunity to choose the right label in the list of interaction possibilities on the left, or he can select the corresponding picture.
	  Besides the <strong>Overview</strong>, the tool ViTA offers 7 other views on the chosen document.

      The visualization <strong>Graph Network</strong> is a representation with nodes and edges of the connection between the characters in the document. Each node represents a character and each edge represents the connection between the two characters. 
      The more important the character, the bigger the node. The more the characters occurs together in a sentence, the wider the edge between the nodes. 
      Right at the start, the most important characters (with the maintained color) are already selected and shown in the visualization. 
      The most common characters with the assigned color are shown in the <strong>Graph Network</strong> with the same color.
 	  The user can add more characters to his selection or deselect characters by clicking on the desired name in the list on the right. With the selection, the border of the name is getting fat.
 	  If the user clicks on an edge between two nodes, the Fingerprint between the two characters will be displayed above the <strong>Graph Network</strong>. 
 	  With a click on the citation in the Fingerprint, the user is forwarded to the Document.
 	  The <strong>Graph Network</strong> includes an important feature. The user has the ability to set the range for the <strong>Graph Network</strong>, for example he just wants to get the <strong>Graph Network</strong> of the interval between chapter 3 and chapter 6.

      The visualization <strong>Word Cloud</strong> is a known visualization. 
      The <strong>Word Cloud</strong> has the functionality, to get a quick gathering of the content. 
      Common words in the document are displayed in a bigger size than less common. 
      In this case, the user has the opportunity to get the Word Cloud <strong>Word Cloud</strong> of the whole document with a click on global in the list on the right. 
      Otherwise he can get the <strong>Word Cloud</strong> of a single character. 
      This <strong>Word Cloud</strong> is compounded of words, which often occurs with the chosen character in a sentence. 
      The colors of the most common characters are maintained and the characters are displayed with the assigned color in the <strong>Word Cloud</strong>.

     The <strong>Plot View</strong> is a specific visualization. The 10 most significant characters are illustrated as lines. 
     Each character line has an own color.  
     This color has no colligation to the color which is assigned to the character in the other visualizations. 
     The lines represents the history of the document. 
     If a characters name is occurred afterwards in the <strong>Plot View</strong>, the character appears later in the history of the document. 
     Each node represents a chapter of the document, except the first nodes next to the names. 
     The first nodes only illustrates the start of the occurrence of the characters.

      The <strong>Fingerprint</strong> is a known visualization too. Each character has a specific bar. The bar symbolizes the whole document. 
      The start of the bar represents the beginning and the end of the bar the ending of the document. 
      The <strong>Fingerprint</strong> illustrates the occurrence of a character. 
      For each occurrence the character gets a small mark in the belonging <strong>Fingerprint</strong> at the correlate passage in the document. 
      The user can set the parts and chapters into the <strong>Fingerprint</strong> by clicking on Toggle seperators.
      To select a character he has to click on the name of the desired character in the list. For Deselection the user has to click again on the name in the list. 
      He also has the ability to select multiple characters to get the <strong>Combination Fingerprint</strong>. 
	  The <strong>Combination Fingerprint</strong> is a <strong>Fingerprint</strong> of the selected characters. 
	  If the chosen characters occur together in a sentence, they’ll get a small mark like for a single character.
	  </br>
	  If the user clicks on one of the small mark, he will be forwarded to the <a ng-href="#/tutorial#document">Document</a>. In the <a ng-href="#/tutorial#document">Document</a> the citation will be highlighted with a specific color.
